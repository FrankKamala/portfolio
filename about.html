						<p>Background</p>
						<h4>What has Kamala been doing? </h4>
						<p>Kamala has a small background in programming . After completion of my Highschool Education, while awaiting admission into University , I started learning basics of programming as a self taught student through online video tutorials and books too.I began doing HTML and CSS basics , later on I managed to enroll for a Java class and Learnt some Java too.
               While doing this i was also able to learn some bit of Python . I was then able to learn Android Application Development basics through an Udacity scholarship in partnership with ALC . I am also familiar with other programming languages such as Kotlin .</p>

						<h4>Why Programming?</h4>
						<p>I fell in love with programming ever since i first learnt how to print out text on a screen. I believe through Programming one is able to solve problems through building web or mobile applications . Besides having fun while coding or programming I believe that learning to program will help you stay relevant in all types of industries. And in todayâ€™s tech-driven society, the more computer skills you have, the easier it will be to get the job you want. Because businesses rely so heavily on web-based processes </p>
